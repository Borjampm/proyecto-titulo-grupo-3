# Risk Prediction Service

This service estimates the likelihood of risks based on structured input data, exposing a simple API suitable for automation and analytics workflows.

## Key Capabilities
- `POST /predict` accepts a JSON payload with the features required for evaluation.
- Returns a probability-like score and optional rationale fields to help interpret the result.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies and start the service with your preferred runtime (Docker, Node, etc.).
2. Define the mandatory input fields in your client and send them to `POST /predict`.
3. Use the returned score to drive alerting, approvals, or downstream decision logic.

For full configuration, model tuning, and deployment guidance, consult the internal architecture docs.
